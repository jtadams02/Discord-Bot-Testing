# JT-Bot
JT-Bot is a discord bot written in python. Mostly a joke but should be able to interface with the BungieAPI when I'm finished  

I don't know Python all that well besides the basics. However, I am hoping that creating this bot will not only help me learn python better, but also help me to learn how to use API's. I plan on writing my own code to interface with the BungieAPI. I don't know how it will go with Python, but it'll help me to learn something
